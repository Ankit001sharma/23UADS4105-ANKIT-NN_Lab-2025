Time Series Forecasting Using Recurrent Neural Networks
This document provides a comprehensive overview of utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for time series forecasting, specifically focusing on predicting daily minimum temperatures in Melbourne, Australia.

Dataset Overview
Dataset Name: Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne

Description: This dataset comprises daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne over a span of 10 years, from 1981 to 1990. It contains 3,650 observations, with each entry representing the minimum temperature of a specific day measured in degrees Celsius. The data was collected by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and is publicly available for analysis.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model capable of forecasting the next day's minimum temperature based on historical data. By leveraging the sequential nature of temperature records, the model aims to capture temporal patterns and trends to make accurate predictions.

Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the model, several preprocessing steps are undertaken:

Normalization: Temperature values are scaled to a range between 0 and 1. This step ensures that the model trains efficiently and converges faster by standardizing the input values.

Sequence Creation: The dataset is transformed into overlapping sequences. Each sequence consists of 30 consecutive days of temperature data, with the subsequent dayâ€™s temperature serving as the target variable. This approach allows the model to learn from a window of past observations to predict future values.

2. Model Architecture
The predictive model is structured as follows:

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): At its core, the model employs an RNN layer with 64 hidden units. RNNs are particularly suited for sequential data as they possess the capability to retain information from previous inputs, making them ideal for time series forecasting.

Fully Connected Layer: Following the RNN layer, a dense (fully connected) layer is used to produce the final output, which is the predicted temperature for the next day.

3. Training Process
The model undergoes training over 100 epochs, utilizing the following configurations:

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE) is employed to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual temperature values. MSE is a standard loss function for regression tasks, penalizing larger errors more significantly.

Optimizer: The Adam optimizer is chosen for its adaptive learning rate properties, facilitating efficient and effective training.

4. Evaluation and Visualization
Post-training, the model's performance is evaluated on a test dataset. The predicted temperatures are compared against the actual recorded values. For clarity and insight, the results are visualized using line plots, where:

The x-axis represents the time steps (days).

The y-axis denotes the temperature in degrees Celsius.

Two lines are plotted: one for actual temperatures and another for predicted values, allowing for a visual assessment of the model's accuracy.

Tools and Libraries Used
PyTorch: An open-source deep learning framework that provides flexibility and speed in building and training neural networks.

Pandas: A data manipulation library essential for handling and processing structured data.

NumPy: A fundamental package for numerical computations in Python.

Matplotlib: A plotting library used to create static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Scikit-learn: A machine learning library that offers simple and efficient tools for data mining and analysis, including preprocessing utilities like data normalization.

Conclusion
By harnessing the capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks, this project effectively models the sequential patterns inherent in daily temperature data. The resulting model demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques in time series forecasting, offering insights that can be valuable for various applications, from weather prediction to climate research.
